# Transfer
Transfer is a direct host-to-host framework for chat\*, sharing files\*, and possibly more. Transfer aspires to be *simply magnificent*. 

## Features
- No need to run a separate server.
- If working behind NATs, requires only a single pinhole in one of the NATs.
- Once an initial connection is achieved, the experience is completely symmetrical from the point of view of users.
- Cross-platform: Written in the Go language.
- A marvellous, terminal-based chat program that isn't confusing at all.

## Limitations
- Currently only designed to work with a single set of peers; although the design is easily adaptable.

## Future work
- \* File transfer
- Folder sharing
- Challenge/Response Authentication
- Encryption
